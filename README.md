# Ferrari Website

A recreation of a service-oriented website for the Ferrari company, offering a schedule page, a payment page and login/sign up pages with all its variants.

I used here for the first time SASS, learning its functions and how to implement it in CSS. Also, I further developed my skills in good practices with HTML, learned more about NODE, JSON files and overall architecture structure.

## Languages and Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript (to be implemented)
